Plant Monitor 

Watering plants is growing to be a hard task that not many can keep up with. Allow me to demonstrate my journey of a plant monitor project that makes life 10x easier; it went from an incomplete circuit that had to overcome the frustrations of loose wires and the ESP8266(WIFI) chip, all the way to a circuit that's efficient and simple; now, the push of a button allows the water pump to send water to a plant, and all plant information is sent to a screen that you can view. This project taught me that there's always an alternate path that we can take to reach a solution/goal which will make the project all the more unique and stronger.

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone 

# First Milestone

My project is creating a plant monitoring system thatâ€™s able to detect the current temperature, humidity, intensity of light and soil moisture of plants. To start, in my milestone 1, I created a connection between the ESP8266, my Arduino(R3) board, and the Blynk application. The ESP8266 acts as a middleman between the communication of the Arduino R3 board and the Blynk application. The ESP chip is a wifi chip that allows the connection between the circuit and the R3 board, allowing the R3 board to deliver the necessary information such as soil moisture information to be viewed on the Blynk application. In my future milestones, I'd like to use these features to be automated using the information from the circuit, which will then determine when the water pump needs to be on or off. Yet, one of the challenges occurring very frequently is the physical cable connections between the R3 board and the ESP causing larger problems with the functionality of the actual ESP wifi connection. In the future, I might have to stop using the ESP8266 due to its recurring problems, so either I'll go around this problem, or figure out how to solve this problem for future milestones.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
